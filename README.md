# Data-Analysis-Basics

📊 **Data Analysis Using Python (Beginner Friendly)**

---

## 👋 Welcome!

This project is a **simple data analysis practice project** using **Python and Pandas**.

In this project, we work with a dataset (like an Excel table) and learn how to:

* Load data
* Look at data
* Clean messy data
* Answer basic questions
* Draw graphs

This notebook is written **step-by-step**, so **beginners can learn easily** 😊

---

## 🧠 What is this project about?

Data is everywhere — marks, prices, ratings, names, etc.

In this project, I used **Pandas** to:

* Read a CSV file
* Check rows and columns
* Fix wrong data types
* Handle missing values
* Group data
* Create simple visualizations

It is like **understanding a class record step by step** 📚

---

## 🛠 Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used:

* **Pandas** → to work with tables (like Excel)
* **NumPy** → to work with numbers
* **Matplotlib** → to draw graphs

## 📌 What is done in the Notebook?

### 🟢 Level 1 – Basic Pandas (Very Easy)

In this part, we learn the basics:

1. Import Pandas library
2. Load CSV file into a DataFrame
3. Display the first 5 rows
4. Check the number of rows and columns
5. View column names
6. Understand the dataset structure

This helps us **know what data we are working with**.

---

### 🟡 Level 2 – Data Understanding

Here we:

1. Check data types of columns
2. Identify string and numeric columns
3. Find missing values
4. Understand why data cleaning is needed

Because real data is **not always perfect** ❌

---

### 🔵 Level 3 – Data Cleaning

In this section, we:

1. Convert string numbers into float values
2. Remove or fix invalid data
3. Handle missing values properly
4. Make the dataset ready for analysis

✅ **Clean data = Better results**

---

### 🟣 Level 4 – Data Analysis

Now we start answering questions:

1. Calculate summary statistics
2. Use `groupby()` to analyze grouped data
3. Find averages and counts
4. Filter data using conditions

This is where **data gives useful information**.

---

## 📊 Data Visualization

Graphs are created to make data easy to understand:

* Scatter plot (example: Actual Price vs Rating)
* Labels added for clarity
* Green color used for better visibility

📈 Graphs help us **see patterns quickly** 👀

---

## 🎯 Why this project is useful?

* Very good for Python beginners
* Helps understand Pandas step by step
* Useful for Data Analyst freshers
* Easy explanation with practice questions

---

## 👨‍🎓 Who should use this project?

* Students learning Python
* Beginners in Data Analysis
* Anyone preparing for interviews
* People practicing Pandas basics

---

## 🌱 Final Words

This project is made with a **learning mindset**.
Each step is explained clearly so **anyone can follow along**.
